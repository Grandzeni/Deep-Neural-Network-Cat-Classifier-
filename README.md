# Deep-Neural-Network-Cat-Classifier-

This project implements a deep neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify images as "cat" or "non-cat". It is a hands-on application of foundational deep learning techniques taught in [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

##  Features

- Implements:
  - 2-layer shallow neural network
  - L-layer deep neural network
- Manual forward and backward propagation
- Cost computation and parameter updates
- Model evaluation and accuracy checking
- Visualization of misclassified examples
- Option to test on custom images
